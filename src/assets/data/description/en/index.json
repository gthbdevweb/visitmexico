    "description": "Mexico’s privileged location allows it to be surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, which makes our country a heavenly destination for tourists that look for sun, beach and sand. The more than 11,000 kilometers of coastline in Mexico allow for every beach to be unique in itself, with waters of different shades, sand with varying textures, dream landscapes and various cultures. The marine plant and animal life also make Mexico a worldwide magnet for tourists. The Sea of Cortés, considered “the world’s aquarium”; the beautiful bay of Acapulco, with one of the most exceptional climates in the world; and the Oaxacan beaches, whose waves are perfect for surfing, are only some examples of what can be enjoyed in the Mexican Pacific; while on the Gulf of Mexico we find the Emerald Coast in Veracruz; and what can we say about the Mexican turquoise blue Caribbean with its white sand.",
